# 🌩️ AWS Lambda Function with Serverless Framework and Express

This project allows you to quickly set up and deploy an AWS Lambda function using express with the Serverless framework. 🚀

## 🛠️ Local Development

For local development, it’s recommended to use my custom development script instead of the standard `serverless dev` command. This will provide a more streamlined experience. 

```
npm run dev
```

## 🚀 Deployment
To deploy your AWS Lambda function, follow these steps:

Install Dependencies
First, make sure all necessary dependencies are installed by running:


```
npm install
```
Deploy to AWS
Once the dependencies are installed, deploy your application to AWS using the Serverless framework with the following command:


```
serverless deploy
```
This command will package your application, upload it to AWS, and set up the necessary infrastructure. 🌐
